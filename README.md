# visual odometry project summers 2015


The src folder contains 3 folders:

1) SFM - computes the Structure from motion given a series of images from a monocular camera

2) SLAM-LC - Fine Tunes the keypoints extracted and computes the trace of the camera along with detecting loop closure

3) display_ftr - plots the keypoints extracted during SFM on the images to visualize the features extracted

For Bundle adjustment, I've used the Ceres sover.
